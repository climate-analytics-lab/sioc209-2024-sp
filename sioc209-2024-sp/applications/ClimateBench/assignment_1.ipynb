    "This assignment encourages a thorough exploration of machine learning techniques in the context of climate science, focusing on hands-on experience and critical analysis. You will be working with the [ClimateBench](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021MS002954) dataset, which contains inputs and associated climate model output from a full complexity Earth System Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the application of different machine learning models to climate-related regression tasks.\n",
    "- Explore and adjust baseline models (Random Forest, Gaussian Process Regression, CNN-LSTM) to enhance performance.\n",
    "- Analyze and report on the effectiveness of model adjustments.\n"
